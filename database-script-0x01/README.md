# Database Schema (DDL) â€“ AirBnB Clone

This script (`schema.sql`) contains SQL statements to create and normalize all entities for the backend database, including:

- Users
- Properties
- Bookings
- Payments
- Reviews
- Status lookup tables

It ensures 3NF compliance, includes indexing for performance, and uses foreign key constraints for relational integrity.
